# ClassOrganizer

I just needed this code to organize a big class. I didn't write it on my own I used DeepSeek to help me. An example of use is inside the code, peace.

## Example usage:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from yourmodule import yourclass
    organized = organize_class_methods(yourclass)
    with open("yournewAhhClass.py", "w", encoding="utf-8") as fo:
        fo.write(organized)

```
